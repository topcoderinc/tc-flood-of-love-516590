To run this web application, extract the contents of the zip file and please ensure all
dependencies are installed.

To install dependencies run within the project folder:
// npm install

Then from within the project folder run the following command:
// npm run serve

This command will serve the project on localhost:3000

From there the app is relatively simple. Select the gender of your
valentine, and answer the descriptors on the input line and press enter.
Each time enter is pressed a new descriptor will be shown. When 0
descriptors are left, the madlib will present itself.

Happy judging!
